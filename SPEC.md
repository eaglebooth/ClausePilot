# ClausePilot specification

## Proof obligation

For one bounded commercial obligation, agreement version, counterparty and sealed checkpoint window, determine whether approved public evidence sufficiently supports `SATISFIED`, `AT_RISK`, `BREACHED` or `UNRESOLVED`.

ClausePilot does not determine legal liability, damages, enforceability or facts outside the approved public source. A missing source is `UNRESOLVED`, never a fabricated breach.

## Architecture

The agreement owner registers an agreement digest and counterparty. The named counterparty first accepts that agreement record. The owner may then add an obligation with an authority origin, evidence URL, object marker, cadence and observation window. The contract hashes the parties and every consequential agreement and obligation field into `terms_digest`; the named counterparty must read and submit that exact digest to accept the obligation before anyone may open a checkpoint. A mismatched digest rolls back. Validators may assess only after the sealed observation window has ended, then independently fetch the authorized URL and judge the bounded semantic relation. Deterministic code enforces consent, agreement version, checkpoint uniqueness, source origin, schedule, observation timing, schema consistency and append-only standing.

## State model

- Agreement: active or inactive; immutable registered version in MVP.
- Obligation: immutable terms digest, counterparty acceptance timestamp, active/inactive status, due sequence, current standing and latest assessed checkpoint.
- Checkpoint: `OPEN`, `ASSESSED` or `UNRESOLVED`.
- Semantic standing: `SATISFIED`, `AT_RISK`, `BREACHED`, `UNRESOLVED`.

Only a result with `scope_relation=MATCH` and `coverage=SUFFICIENT` can create a non-unresolved standing. `BREACHED` additionally requires at least one positive material fact.

## Intentional limitations

- One approved public source per obligation in MVP.
- External keepers open due checkpoints; the contract does not claim autonomous scheduling.
- No escrow, payouts, private PDF storage, arbitrary URL crawling or automatic enforcement.
- Vendor publications prove what the vendor published, not universal objective truth.
